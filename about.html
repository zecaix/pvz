      <h3>What do you do  <br>when there's a zombie on your lawn? </h3>
      <p> If you answered "start planting flowers to defeat it," then you’ve likely heard of 
        Plants vs. Zombies. Armed with dozens of zombie-zapping plants, from the classic peashooter to the devious cherry bomb, you’ll need to 
        think fast and plant faster to stop all types of zombies dead in their tracks. And just when you think you’ve got a handle on things, 
        obstacles like a setting sun and creeping fog add to the challenge. With 5 game modes to dig into, the fun never dies!</p>

        <h1 class="heading">Plants Vs Zombies <span>What is it?</span></h1>
        <p>Plants vs. Zombies (abbreviated as PvZ) is a tower defense video game developed and originally published by PopCap Games and it is the 
            first installment in the Plants vs. Zombies series. The game involves homeowners who use a variety of different plants to prevent waves
             of zombies from entering their houses and "eating their brains". It follows the affiliates of David "Crazy Dave" Blazing as they use 
             his plants to defend against a zombie invasion, led by Dr. Edgar George Zomboss. Plants vs. Zombies is a video game where players 
             strategically place different plants and fungi around a house to prevent zombies from reaching it. The game has different levels 
             and layouts, including nighttime and rooftop levels, with various types of zombies that have different attributes. The player must 
             gather "sun" to plant and purchase upgrades for their plants. If a zombie reaches the player's house, the game ends with a message 
             saying "The zombies ate your brains!"</p>

        <h1 class="heading">Plants Vs Zombies <span>History</span></h1>
        <p>It was first going to release on October 28, 2008, back when it was titled Bloom & Doom, but as an early version, and it got delayed. 
            It was first released on May 5, 2009. The game received a positive response from critics and was nominated for multiple Interactive 
            Achievement Awards, alongside receiving praise for its musical score. The game is followed by a sequel, Plants vs. Zombies 2, which 
            was released on July 9, 2013, in Australia and New Zealand, then it was released worldwide on August 15, 2013. <br> Plants vs. Zombies 
            is a game that uses many cultural references in its names of stages and mini-games. The gravestones' inscriptions and several levels 
            in the game reference Monty Python, Harry Potter, Isaac Asimov's I, Robot, Led Zeppelin, and gaming memes. The dancing zombie
             originally resembled Michael Jackson, but it was replaced with a disco-dancing zombie after objections from Michael Jackson's estate. 
             The game was originally planned to be called Lawn of the Dead, but George A. Romero didn't give permission to use the name. 
             Plants vs. Zombies has been released on multiple platforms and has been referenced in other games as well.<br><br> Overall It's a delightful game that is both addictive and accessible, and you'll never look at your garden the same way again.</p>
